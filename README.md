## Who am I?
I am Charles Yang, a software and rock climbing guy.
My skills include:
* Python
* C# .NET, legacy or otherwise
* Version Control
* Github Actions
* Various flavors of SQL
* Various flavors of NoSQL (DynamoDB, etc)
* RESTful APIs
* AWS, including CDK for IaC
* Basic front-end design & development

Non-technical skills include:
* Falling off anything harder than V6
* Trad & Lead climbing
* Hiking
* Cooking (is this considered technical?)

Currently working at QCI, a software consulting firm in West Des Moines, IA. Subject to relatively relaxed non-compete. As of 12/18/2022, I am not seeking new employment but am willing to network!

## What is this?
This is the second edition of my personal website. I had some goals for this iteration:
1. Learn fundamentals of Next.js
2. Do some fun software architecture
3. Exercise my existing skills
4. Reduce the cost and complexity of my website
5. Showcase myself

Much of the technology used may be a little overkill. For example, I have yet to dive into Next.js' server-side capabilities. However, my goal wasn't to find the exactly correct tool for the job, but rather to learn and exercise my skills.

## Technical Bits for IYarles2
* AWS CDK for IaC (Infrastructure as Code)
* AWS S3 for storing assets and static website hosting
* AWS Route53 for DNS
* Next.js in TypeScript as framework for choice
* Github Actions for CI/CD
* AWS Lambda & API Gateway for serverless functions (contact page, etc)
